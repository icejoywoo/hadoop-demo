## Hadoop MiniCluster for MR2

This project provides a complete example of using the Hadoop MiniCluster with MR2 to create test case for Hadoop jobs.

This will allow you to run JUnit test cases from end to end of your MR jobs. This fires up a memory resident cluster and allows for everything to be tested--no mocking here.
